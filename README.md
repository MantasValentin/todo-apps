# Overview

Simple todo lists using react for the front-end, node for the back-end and a specified database. I made these just for learning.

## Requirements

Need to [install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and launch it


## Getting Started

Run this command in the terminal at the one of the projects directories and open http://localhost:3000/
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
